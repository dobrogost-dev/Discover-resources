# Discover-resources
A Victoria 3 mod that lets you discover other types of resources

What does this mod do?
This mod rebalances the game by letting all countries discover base resources like Iron, Coal, Lead and Sulfur just like Oil, Rubber or Gold in the base game.
It also increases amount of lumber in places where it makes sense (Siberia, Amazonia, Congo Rainforest etc).
Discoverable Resources are distributed around the world based on historical data and proper balance, the mod doesnt give everyone everything, some countries are richer in certain goods and still lack others and will have to import what isn't mined in the country.
As the game progresses the amount of resources will increase overall, which will help solve the lategame worldwide lack of everything without giving you unlimited resources.
